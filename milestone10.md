### Elevator Pitch & Heilmeier's Catechism 
- **What are you trying to do?**   
We're trying to add another dimension to the consumer experience by tangibly rewarding customer engagement through targeted, location-based deals and discounts. Ultimately, we aim to allow companies to create "locus points", or local deals, which presents users with a unique deal, event, or promotion happening around them. In a phrase, we want to utilize the power of modern technology to revolutionize the current marketing environment in a forward-facing, linearly growing, but ultimately positive direction.
  
- **How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**   
Coupons, web advertisements, radio & television commercials, e-mail promotion campaigns, and customer account discounts generally account for the current market of the business-consumer relationship. The limits of these practices are clear - uncertain customer engagement, annoyance, cost prohibitiveness, and expensive statistical analysis are all limitations involved. These are blunt tools when a scalpel should be used; a world inundated with advertisements distracts and interrupts instead of providing utility.
  
- **What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**   
Our app gives the consumer the space to seek out and find promotions that pertain to them individually and geographically. It allows the user to come to the business, instead of company advertisements forcing themselves in the experience of the consumer. Our approach aims to take the power to the consumer, and make advertisements useful and *welcome* again.
  
- **Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?**   
Our app could alter the current capatalist-consumer technology spectrum, changing the paradigm about how we interact with the businesses and products we interact with. We want to solve a breakdown in the modern consumer experience by creating a fun environment that makes shopping malls more exciting, that makes a walk an opportunity for saving money, and that makes advertisements more inviting and enjoyable.
