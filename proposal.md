Proposed features:
Ability for third party companies and stores to drop promotions based on location (E.G. you're at the beach and you get a notification for 25% off local surf shop)
Ability for third party companies and stores to start competitions for their promotions or products(E.G. you're at the beach and you get a notification for whoever can post a video of the best wave gets 25% wet suit from Matuse)
Users can follow their favorite brands and stores and get discounts on their favorite products by going out and doing activities
Potential ability to search for promotions with augmented reality overlay (similar to pokemon go).
