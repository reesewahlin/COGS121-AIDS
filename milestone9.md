# Milestone 9

## Division of work:
### Reese Wahlin;
Worked on core map interactions including accepting form input and committing it to a temporary data store, presenting the information on the map, interactions with the Locus Point map markers, and creating new promotion screens.

### Chad Bettencourt: 
Worked on rigging up project framework for navigation between map, promotions, and promotion creation – as well as working on taking user input and displaying it via the locus point markers, user flow with the map markers, and implementing the search bar as well as location titles for each locus point.

### Nick Campbell: 
Worked on fleshing out app style – created high fidelity prototypes of the promotion screen, fleshed out the apps color scheme, created the logo, and finalized iconography.
