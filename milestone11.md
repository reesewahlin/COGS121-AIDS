Here is the app's promo-creation screen. This is where a merchant creates their promotion title and details after specifying it's geographic location. They also have the option of uploading their own QR code to create a scannable promotion.

![Promo Viewing](https://github.com/reesewahlin/COGS121-Guography/blob/master/storyboards/M11-promo-viewing.png)

Here is the app's promo-viewing screen. This is where a user views promotions on the map after they've been created by a particular merchant. They can save the QR code to later use the promotion, or save the locus point to their library for a later visit.
