### Description:
This is the map screen. Last week it displayed your location and you had the ability to create a generic google maps marker. Now if you navigate away from your location, theres a locate button at the top right that moves the map frame to your location. Furthermore, when creating a pin now, it creates a proprietary pin with our own design. Clicking on the pin displays a brief overview of the promotion at that locus point. Also, clicking on the pin triggers a function bar at the bottom right that allows the user to navigate to the location of the locus point. at the bottom left, there is now a button that allows the user to create a locus point. It is not finished yet, but it currently links to the form that will be used by businesses to specify the relevant details of their promotion.
