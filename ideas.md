People with them join their group and also post an emoji describing what theyre doing. Other users see your emoji next to your name, as well as the people with you at the location

2) Neighborhood watch. Heatmap of people in your neighborhood with arrest records.

3) Midpoint finder. Service that helps you find a meetup point between people

4) AR Geocaching. Leave things at peoples wifi networks that can be seen and downloaded in AR.
