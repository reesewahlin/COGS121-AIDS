# Team C8: Guography
## App Name: Locus
## Milestone 14 Contributions:
### Nick Campbell:
- Finish design decisions / UI implementation: designed the look and feel of the final app including the account creation page, promotion creation page, view promotion page, final map pin icon iteration, and aided Reese with design implementation nvolving the final flow of the application.

### Reese Wahlin:
- Revamp login screen flow by allowing User and Enterprise customers the ability to Sign up and Log in and be redirected to the map screen
- Finalized design implementations with Nick on the native android app

### Chad Bettencourt:
- Implementing "locus point" (promotion) persistance - i.e. allowing the promotions to persist throughout different accounts & types of accounts. This means that the promotions are more _real_, meaning they actually exist and can be viewed across the app/userbase.
- Reimplement the search functionality to allow searching for locations and fix some of the technical issues we were having.

## App Description & Features:
- Our app aims to create a new way for companies to promote their products and events locally, by allowing companies to create precise "locus points", or pins on the map that are of interest to their customers. Companies drop a pin to create a locus point, and customize it with their logo, company name, promotion or event title, information about the promotion or event, and even the ability to upload a QR code to make the promotion _scannable_. An average, non-enterprise user sees a map populated with these locus points, that allows them to engage in the world around them and take advantage of these exclusive deals. We foresee companies having surf competitions at the beach, or limited time flash sales available only to people in the immediate area, or having philanthropy events, and our app aims to facillitate that connection.
